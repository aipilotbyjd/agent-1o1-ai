 * that limit is a fatal error nothing can catch: the reply is lost, the
 * subagents' results were already collected, and the turn's `Run` is left
 * `running` for good.
 *
 * The limit is raised, not removed, so a hung provider call still ends. It
 * allows for a subagent running its full `RunSubagentTaskJob::$timeout`
 * (300s) and the turn around it.
