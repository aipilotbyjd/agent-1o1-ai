 * `StoreAgentRequest`/`UpdateAgentRequest` actually validate against
 * (`exists:model_catalog,id`) — a picker built on this response needs it to
 * submit a selection. Deliberately excludes `routes` — which real
 * backend(s), credentials, and priorities serve this entry is never exposed
 * to agent/workflow-facing API responses. See `Services\Ai\ModelCatalogResolver`.
 *
 * Availability, the reason a model can't run, whether it runs on the
 * workspace's own key, the admin's allow-list and default, and the cost
 * hint all come from the `WorkspaceModelView` it's given — the platform's
 * view when none is.
