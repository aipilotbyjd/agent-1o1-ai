 * are Stripe's record, and a copy in our database would only be a second
 * source of truth to keep in sync. The cost is that these endpoints fail when
 * Stripe does, which is the right trade for a settings screen.
 *
 * `Cashier::useCustomerModel(Workspace::class)` makes the workspace the Stripe
 * customer, so all of this hangs off `$workspace` directly.

     * Cursor-paginated because Stripe's list API is: it has no total count
     * and no offset, so the client walks `next_cursor` rather than asking for
     * page 7. A workspace that never reached checkout has no Stripe customer,
     * and Cashier returns an empty collection for it rather than erroring —
     * the common case for a Free workspace opening the billing screen.
