/**
 * Provisioning credentials without a browser — what the `connectors:manage`
 * key ability was defined for. A platform that creates a workspace per
 * customer needs to attach that customer's API keys programmatically; doing
 * it by hand in the UI doesn't scale.
 *
 * OAuth connectors are refused here on purpose: their credentials come from
 * an authorization redirect that only a browser can complete, and accepting
 * hand-written token data for one would produce a credential that silently
 * can't refresh itself.
 *
 * `created_by` stays null — an API key belongs to a workspace, not a person.
