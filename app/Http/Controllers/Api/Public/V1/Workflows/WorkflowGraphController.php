 *
 * The two-step draft-then-publish split is deliberate and mirrors the
 * editor's: `replace()` accepts a mid-edit graph (only per-node config
 * schemas are checked), while `publish()` runs the full `GraphValidator`
 * sequence and is what makes the workflow runnable. Both surface failures as
 * 422s via `WorkflowValidationException`.
