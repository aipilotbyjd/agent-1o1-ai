/**
 * Turns accrued overage into a Stripe invoice — the second half of
 * Gumloop's "keep running past your monthly credits, billed at $0.005 per
 * credit". Overage is metered as it is spent (`DeductCreditsAction` writes
 * `usage_periods.overage_credits_used`) and charged after the fact, because
 * invoicing per node run would mean a Stripe call inside the metering path.
 *
 * Claiming the credits and recording a `pending` `OverageInvoiceAttempt`
 * happen in one transaction, *before* the Stripe call; the claim is undone if
 * the call throws. A process that dies in between leaves the pending attempt
 * behind, and the next run reconciles it against Stripe (the invoice carries
 * the attempt id in its metadata): an invoice found means the credits really
 * were billed, none means they go back on the unbilled pile. That keeps the
 * "never double-charge" ordering without being able to lose revenue.
 *
 * A closed period can never accrue more, so what falls under the invoice
 * minimum is carried: the credits of every closed period of a workspace are
 * pooled and invoiced together once they add up to the minimum.
