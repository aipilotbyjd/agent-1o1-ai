/**
 * The only place that writes `credit_transactions`/increments
 * `usage_periods.credits_used`: everything else (the `RecordRunCreditUsage`
 * listener today; agent tool-call metering, usage endpoints, later) goes
 * through this action so "what does charging credits actually do" has one
 * implementation. Locks the usage period row so two concurrent charges
 * against the same workspace can't both pass a limit check that only one of
 * them should have.
 *
 * A charge is paid from the workspace's `CreditWallet` (allowance grants
 * before carry-over grants, paid top-ups last), then (where the workspace
 * opted into credit overage) accrues the rest as overage to be invoiced
 * after the fact, and finally, for work that already ran, records debt.
 * Each ledger row lists the grants that paid for it.
 *
 * Idempotent per `(source_type, source_id)`: charging the same `NodeRun` or
 * `AgentMessage` twice returns the original ledger row untouched. The
 * listener runs on a queue and bills a run's node runs one at a time, so a
 * retry after a mid-loop failure would otherwise re-bill every node already
 * charged.
 *
 * Being the single metering seam also makes it the right place to raise the
 * `usage.threshold_crossed` admin alert. It is raised *outside* the
 * transaction: the period and workspace rows are locked inside it, and no
 * notification work may run while those locks are held. The companion
 * `usage.limit_exhausted` alert lives on `CreditGate` instead: charges here
 * run in overdraft mode for work that already executed, so this is no longer
 * where a workspace is actually refused.
