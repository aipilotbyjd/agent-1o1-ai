/**
 * Turns a paid-for `PlanGrant` into live entitlement. Beyond flipping the
 * status this must re-open the usage period itself: a lifetime purchase
 * produces no `customer.subscription.created`, so nothing else would resize
 * `usage_periods.credits_limit` and the workspace would sit on the Free
 * allowance until the next month rolled over.
 *
 * The period is sized from `currentPlan()`, not the granted plan, so buying
 * a lifetime Starter while subscribed to Pro doesn't cut the allowance down
 * to Starter's — see `Workspace::currentPlan()`.
 *
 * Idempotent: safe to call again for the same grant (e.g. a redelivered
 * webhook), since an `Active` grant is a no-op.
