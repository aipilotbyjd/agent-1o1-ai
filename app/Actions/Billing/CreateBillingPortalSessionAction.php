 * Opens a Stripe-hosted Billing Portal session, where a customer manages the
 * things this API deliberately doesn't reimplement: payment methods, invoice
 * history and receipts, and cancelling a subscription. Stripe owns those
 * screens, keeps them PCI-compliant, and localises them — rebuilding card
 * capture here would mean handling card data we currently never touch.
 *
 * Requires the Customer Portal to be configured once in the Stripe dashboard
 * (Settings → Billing → Customer portal); without it Stripe rejects the
 * session-create call.
 *
 * The return URL is built here rather than accepted from the caller — the
 * same rule the checkout actions follow. Stripe sends the customer's browser
 * wherever this points, so taking it from the request would turn the endpoint
 * into an open redirect.
