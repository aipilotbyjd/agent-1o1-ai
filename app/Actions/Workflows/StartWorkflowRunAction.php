/**
 * Creates a `runs` row pinned to the workflow's `current_version_id` — never
 * the live draft, so editing a workflow never changes what an in-flight run
 * executes (docs/WORKFLOWS_PLAN.md) — and dispatches the entry node(s).
 * Called from the Internal/Public API `RunController`s, `SubWorkflowCoordinator`/
 * `LoopCoordinator` (child runs, `$parentNode` set) and the trigger pipeline
 * (`App\Services\Triggers\TargetRunStarter`, docs/TRIGGERS_PLAN.md).
 *
 * Top-level runs go through `CreditGate` first, so a workspace out of credits
 * is refused before any node executes rather than after the LLM spend has
 * already happened. Child runs (`$parentNode` set) are exempt — see below.
