/**
 * Re-executes a finished run as a brand-new `Run` — never by mutating the
 * original, whose `node_runs` and credit-ledger entries are the record of
 * what actually happened.
 *
 * The retry pins to the *original's* `workflow_version_id`, not the
 * workflow's current version: a retry reproduces the run that failed, and
 * pinning to `current_version_id` would silently execute a different graph
 * than the one being retried (and break `from_node_key`, whose node might no
 * longer exist). Publishing a fix and running that is a normal new run, not a
 * retry.
 *
 * `trigger_type` carries over for the same reason — among other things it
 * decides whether pinned node data short-circuits execution
 * (`WorkflowRunner::executeNodeContract()`), so a retried webhook run must
 * stay a webhook run rather than quietly becoming a manual, pin-using one.
