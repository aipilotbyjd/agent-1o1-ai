/**
 * Lets an agent with `allow_self_updates` rewrite its own instructions when
 * the user corrects it or states a lasting preference. Saving goes through
 * `AgentObserver`, so every change is a new `AgentVersion` that can be rolled
 * back. The agent is reloaded rather than saved from the turn's copy, which
 * is a pinned-version snapshot whose other attributes aren't the live ones.
 *
 * The model sees its full prompt, which also carries the skills, knowledge
 * and memories `SkillInjector` adds. Models copy those back despite being
 * told not to, often slightly reworded, so any injected section is stripped
 * before saving, and then any line that closely matches an injected line
 * without being in the current base instructions; otherwise it would be
 * duplicated, freeze details like today's date, and outlive the skill being
 * detached. Models asked for only the change instead tend not to call the
 * tool at all.
 *
 * Only when the person it's working for (or the agent's creator, for a run
 * nobody started) may manage agents — otherwise anyone who can chat with it
 * could permanently change it for the whole workspace, which the agent's
 * settings page wouldn't let them do.
 *
 * The conversation the correction was made in is moved onto the new
 * version, so the change applies from the agent's next reply there rather
 * than only in later conversations.
