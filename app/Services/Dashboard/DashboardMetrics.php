/**
 * Every aggregate the dashboard endpoints read. Kept out of the controllers
 * because the overview endpoint composes the same numbers the drill-down
 * endpoints return on their own, and "what counts as a run" must not be
 * answered twice.
 *
 * What counts as a run, everywhere here: top-level runs only
 * (`parent_run_id is null`) with `node_test` excluded. Loop iterations and
 * Loop Mode child runs are real rows in `runs`, so counting them would report
 * a 3-item loop as four runs; single-node tests from the builder are real
 * runs too, and a "12 runs today" tile that moves every time someone taps
 * Test is worse than useless. `RunController::index` draws the same two lines
 * via `exclude_trigger_type`, so the dashboard and the run list agree.
 *
 * Credits are read from `credit_transactions` rather than summed off node
 * runs: the ledger is the billing record, it already carries a
 * `(workspace_id, created_at)` index, and it covers agent turns and evals
 * that never produced a `NodeRun` at all.
