/**
 * "New event" in Stripe through a webhook endpoint on the account.
 *
 * One endpoint per set of event types and connected account, shared by every
 * trigger that asks for the same set (no types means every event, `*`). Stripe
 * hands out the endpoint's signing secret once, when it is made, and signs each
 * delivery with it (`Stripe-Signature`, see StripeIngress). A delivery only makes
 * the trigger's own poll look now, so the poll's filters, order and dedupe by
 * event id still decide what runs: an event Stripe delivers twice, or that both
 * push and poll see, starts one run.
 *
 * Stripe switches an endpoint off after days of failed deliveries, so the daily
 * renewal turns it back on, and makes it again if someone deleted it.
