/**
 * Everything that has to be settled when a run stops before its graph is
 * finished. Extracted from `WorkflowRunner::cancel()` so the *failure* paths
 * — `StepFailureHandler::failRun()` and `LoopCoordinator`'s `fail_fast` —
 * can reuse it without depending on `WorkflowRunner`, which would close a
 * dependency cycle (`WorkflowRunner` → `StepFailureHandler` → back again).
 *
 * A run that stops early leaves two kinds of debris behind, and both matter
 * however it stopped:
 *
 * - Node runs parked on a person (`awaiting_approval`) or on an inbound
 *   webhook (`awaiting_callback`). Their callback URL keeps resolving until
 *   the token is nulled, so an approval on an already-dead run stays
 *   actionable and a `Wait` node stays resumable.
 * - Child runs a `subflow`/`loop` node started. Those keep executing — and
 *   keep billing — to produce output whose parent node has already settled
 *   and will never read it.

     * `CancelRunAction` resolves it.
