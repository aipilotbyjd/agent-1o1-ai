/**
 * Simulates a draft graph without calling anything external — no
 * `NodeContract::execute()` calls, ever. Each node's config is
 * template-resolved (`TemplateResolver`, Stage 5) against a context built
 * from placeholder outputs of the nodes before it in topological order, which
 * catches the authoring mistakes that otherwise only surface at run time: a
 * template pointing at a node that runs later, a misspelled path, wiring
 * that doesn't resolve — all without side effects. Backs
 * `Ai\Tools\WorkflowBuilder\DryRunWorkflowTool`.
 *
 * Each node's simulated output is shaped like its real one when that shape
 * is known — from the node's own pinned data, else from what nodes of its
 * type have produced in the workspace (`NodeOutputShapes`) — so a misspelled
 * field is caught. A reference into a node whose shape is *not* known can't
 * be judged either way; it is reported under `unverified` rather than as a
 * warning, so a first-time graph isn't buried in false alarms.
 *
 * `warnings` are worded for the workflow builder's model; `findings` carry
 * the same problems placed on their step and config field, worded for the
 * person editing, which the editor lists alongside what blocks publishing.
