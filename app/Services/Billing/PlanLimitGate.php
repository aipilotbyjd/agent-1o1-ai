/**
 * The resource-cap check, sibling to `CreditGate`. Credits meter how much
 * work a workspace may *do*; this caps how much it may *own* — the tier
 * differentiator `Plan.limits` sells but nothing previously enforced.
 *
 * Deliberately fails open twice over. A workspace whose `currentPlan()` is
 * null (a half-seeded install, per `config/billing.php`) is never refused,
 * and a plan that doesn't mention a limit is treated as unlimited rather
 * than as zero — so adding a `PlanLimit` case can't retroactively lock every
 * existing workspace out of creating anything.
 *
 * The check runs on create only. A workspace pushed over a cap by a
 * *downgrade* keeps everything it already has and can still edit it; it just
 * can't add more until it's back under.
