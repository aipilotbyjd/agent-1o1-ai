 * and by how much" — Gumloop's credit overage: "enable credit overage to
 * keep running past your monthly credits, billed at $0.005 per credit"
 * (docs/gumloop/output/raw/core-concepts/credits.md).
 *
 * Three independent things have to line up before a single overage credit is
 * granted, and each is a deliberate off switch:
 *
 * 1. the workspace's current plan carries the `credit_overage` feature,
 * 2. the workspace has opted in (`credit_overage_enabled`),
 * 3. the current period's overage is still under the effective ceiling.
 *
 * `CreditGate` consults this to decide whether a run may start at a zero
 * balance, and `DeductCreditsAction` to decide how much of a charge overage
 * may absorb. Both read it through the same `remainingFor()` so a run can
 * never be admitted on an allowance the charge would then refuse.
