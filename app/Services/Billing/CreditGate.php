/**
 * The pre-flight balance check. Credits are metered *after* the fact, on
 * `RunCompleted` — without a gate a workspace at zero still executed its
 * whole DAG (and paid for the LLM tokens) before the charge was even
 * attempted. This refuses the run up front instead, mapping to a 402 through
 * `bootstrap/app.php`.
 *
 * The check is deliberately coarse: a run's true cost isn't knowable until
 * its nodes have executed, so this only asserts the workspace can afford to
 * begin. A run that overruns the remaining balance still completes and is
 * billed in full (see `DeductCreditsAction`'s overdraft mode) — the *next*
 * run is the one that gets refused.
 *
 * A workspace that opted into credit overage is not refused at zero: the
 * allowance it may still spend on top is `CreditOverage`'s to answer, and
 * only once *that* is gone does this refuse. Both paths raise the
 * `usage.limit_exhausted` admin alert, but they tell the customer different
 * things — a spent allowance resets with the period, a spent overage cap
 * does not.
