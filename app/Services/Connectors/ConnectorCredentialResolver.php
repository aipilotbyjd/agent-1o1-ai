/**
 * Turns a node's `config` into a usable access token for one connector,
 * scoped to a workspace and the user acting in it. A `ConnectorCredential`
 * is always looked up by `workspace_id` first — a caller can never reach a
 * credential belonging to another workspace by guessing its id — with a
 * fallback to a plain `access_token` config field for backward
 * compatibility with nodes configured before `ConnectorCredential` existed
 * (docs/PLAN.md Phase 6).
 *
 * With neither pinned, falls back to a *default* credential — Gumloop's
 * "Personal Default"/"if you only have one account connected, it's
 * automatically your default" (see
 * docs/gumloop/output/raw/core-concepts/credentials.md). The acting user's
 * personal default takes priority over the workspace's team default,
 * matching the doc's "everyone uses their own account by default" rule of
 * thumb.
 *
 * Shared by node execution (`ResolvesConnectorCredential`, acting user =
 * `Run::triggered_by`) and the editor's dynamic field options
 * (`NodeOptionsService`, acting user = the member editing the node).
