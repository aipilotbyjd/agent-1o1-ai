 * Recording and notifying live together on purpose: every call site that has
 * enough context to log an event has exactly the context the alert needs, and
 * keeping them apart reliably produced logged-but-unannounced events.
 *
 * The request is resolved per call rather than injected: the router caches a
 * controller instance on its Route, so anything this class held from its
 * constructor would describe whichever request happened to build it first.
