/**
 * Runs a suite against its agent and records how every case graded.
 *
 * Each case is a fresh, stateless turn (`AgentRunner::ask()`), never a shared
 * conversation: cases must not be able to influence one another, or a suite's
 * result would depend on the order its cases happen to be in.
 *
 * **Cases execute for real, tools included.** That is the point — an eval of
 * an agent whose tools were stubbed would grade a different agent than the
 * one in production — but it does mean a suite aimed at a tool-using agent
 * can cause real side effects, exactly as chatting with that agent would.
 * Suites for such agents should be written against read-only prompts.
 *
 * The whole grading pass is recorded as one `Run` (`runnable_type =
 * AgentEvalRun`), which is what puts eval spend on the same ledger as
 * everything else — see `RecordRunCreditUsage`. A case's recorded usage
 * includes its rubric judge's tokens, so judging is billed too.
 *
 * `start()` is the HTTP entry point: a suite makes one model call per case
 * (plus a judge call per rubric), too slow to run inside a request, so it
 * queues `RunAgentEvalJob`, which calls `execute()`. `run()` does both in
 * one go for callers that want the result inline.
 *
 * A completed run is compared with the suite's previous completed run; one
 * that passes a smaller share of its cases is marked `regressed`, and when
 * nobody started it by hand (`EvalRunTrigger::AgentChange`) the workspace's
 * owners and admins are told.
