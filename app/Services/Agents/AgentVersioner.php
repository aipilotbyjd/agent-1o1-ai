/**
 * Writes and replays `agent_versions` — the Agent layer's counterpart to
 * `Workflow::publishVersion()`, minus the publish step: an agent has no
 * draft/published split, so every behavioral edit simply becomes the next
 * version.
 *
 * What a snapshot captures is deliberately wider than what
 * `AgentSession::pinnedAgent()` replays. The scalar behavior fields are
 * pinned to a live conversation; attached tools and skills are recorded for
 * audit and restore only, and are always read live at run time. Replaying an
 * old binding set would resurrect tools an admin has since detached —
 * possibly because the credential behind one was revoked — which is not a
 * decision a months-old snapshot should get to make.
