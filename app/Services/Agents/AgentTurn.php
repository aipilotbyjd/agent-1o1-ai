/**
 * Everything one chat turn needs after its setup and before its result —
 * carried between `AgentRunner`'s `openTurn()` and `completeTurn()` so the
 * synchronous and streaming paths share exactly one definition of what a
 * turn is.
 *
 * `provider`/`model` are captured here rather than re-read from the agent
 * later: they come from the session's *pinned* version, and re-reading them
 * at completion time would reintroduce the drift pinning exists to prevent.
 *
 * `provider` is either a plain provider name (agent has no `model_catalog_id`)
 * or the ordered `provider => model` failover chain resolved from one by
 * `Services\Ai\ModelCatalogResolver` — see `AgentRunner::openTurn()`. `model`
 * is only meaningful in the former case; a resolved chain already carries
 * its own model ids and is passed with `model: null`.
