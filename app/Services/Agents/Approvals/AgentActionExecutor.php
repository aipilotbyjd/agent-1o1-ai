 * Settles a paused turn's decided calls before the model hears about them:
 * each approved call is run here, through its own tool (so it goes through
 * the same guard, bound-field filter and billing as any call), and its
 * result stored on the action. Only then is the turn resumed — the SDK's
 * own re-run of an approved call finds the stored result and hands it back
 * rather than running it again (`ActionGuard::run()`).
 *
 * Running them here first means an approved action happens exactly once
 * and its outcome is recorded even if the model call that follows fails.
