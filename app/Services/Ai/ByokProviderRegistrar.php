/**
 * Bring your own key, at call time. `ModelCatalogResolver` stays global —
 * it answers "which backends serve this model" — and this answers "whose
 * key pays for each of them" for one workspace and one acting member.
 *
 * For every hop of a provider chain whose provider has a usable key here
 * (the member's own personal key first, then the workspace's team key),
 * the key is registered as a runtime provider (`byok-{credential id}`, the
 * same driver and URL as the static entry it stands in for) and put just
 * ahead of that hop:
 *
 *     ['openai' => 'gpt-4o']  →  ['byok-9f…' => 'gpt-4o', 'openai' => 'gpt-4o']
 *
 * The platform's own hop stays behind it (when the platform has a key for
 * it), so a failover-worthy error on the workspace's key — rate limited,
 * out of quota — still lands on a working backend. A hop nobody has a key
 * for — no platform key, no workspace key — is left out, so a route can be
 * enabled for a provider the platform doesn't pay for and only workspaces
 * that brought a key for it will use it; everyone else goes straight to
 * the next hop instead of failing on a keyless call. A rejected key is not
 * failover-worthy to the SDK; the scheduled re-check takes such a key out
 * of rotation instead (`CheckAiProviderCredentialJob`).
 *
 * The SDK reports the serving provider's config name back on every
 * response, so `isByok()` on a usage record says whose key ran the call —
 * which is how `CreditMeter` knows not to bill its tokens.
