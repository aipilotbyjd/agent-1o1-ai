 * Sent on every failed collection attempt, escalating with Stripe's own
 * `attempt_count` rather than a timer of ours.
 *
 * The wording is blunt about access because this app grants no grace period:
 * a `past_due` subscription stops entitling immediately (see
 * `Workspace::activeSubscription()`), since every workflow run costs real
 * model spend. Softening that to "you may lose access" would be a lie.
