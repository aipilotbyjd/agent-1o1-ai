/**
 * Invoices the overage every closed billing period accrued, pooling a
 * workspace's closed periods so a remainder under the invoice minimum is
 * carried into the next invoice rather than stranded. Runs daily
 * rather than at the moment a period ends, so a Stripe outage or a declined
 * card is retried on the next run instead of losing the charge — the credits
 * stay unbilled until an invoice actually succeeds.
 *
 * Only *ended* periods are billed. A period still accruing would need a
 * second invoice for whatever it spent afterwards, which is a worse
 * experience than one line at the end of the cycle and is not how Gumloop
 * bills it either.
