/**
 * Both version tables carry a `unique({parent}_id, version)` constraint, and
 * both writers pick the next number with `max('version') + 1`. Two writers
 * racing for that number must not surface as a failed request — the loser
 * re-reads the watermark and takes the next one instead.
 *
 * The race is simulated by a one-shot `creating` hook that rewrites the
 * pending row's number to one already taken, which is exactly the state a
 * concurrent writer leaves behind between our watermark read and our insert.
