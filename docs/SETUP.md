# Project Setup Guide

How to set the project up from scratch on a local machine. Work through the sections in order. This guide grows as the project does: add new steps under the section they belong to.

## 1. Requirements

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PHP | 8.4 | `composer.json` allows `^8.3` |
| Composer | 2.x | |
| Node.js and npm | current LTS | Vite and the frontend build |
| PostgreSQL | 16 or newer | The real database. Tests use SQLite instead |
| Laravel Herd | latest | Serves the app at `https://agent-1o1-ai.test` |

## 2. Install dependencies

```bash
composer install
npm install --ignore-scripts
npm run build
```

`composer run setup` runs the install, env copy, key generation, migrations and build in one go. It runs `migrate --force` against whatever database `.env` points at, so do sections 3 to 5 first if you want it to use PostgreSQL.

## 3. Environment file

Copy the template and edit the copy. Never commit `.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env.example` is grouped into labeled sections (Application, Database, Mail, AI Providers, Authentication, Billing, Triggers and so on). Keep that layout when you add a variable: put it in its section and, if it is optional, comment it out with a one-line note.

Back up an existing `.env` before replacing it:

```bash
cp -p .env .env.backup && chmod 600 .env.backup
```

Git ignores `.env.backup`. It holds secrets, so keep it out of anything shared.

## 4. Application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

This writes `APP_KEY` into `.env`. Run it once per environment. Generating a new key later invalidates encrypted data and sessions made with the old one.

## 5. Database

The template defaults to SQLite (`DB_CONNECTION=sqlite`). Development and production use PostgreSQL, so switch to it.

### 5.1 Create the database

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U <your-user> -d postgres -c "create database agent1o1_dev"
```

Postgres folds unquoted names to lowercase, so use lowercase names. To list databases:

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U <your-user> -d postgres -Atc "select datname from pg_database where not datistemplate order by 1"
```

### 5.2 Point `.env` at it

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=agent1o1_dev
DB_USERNAME=<your-user>
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Leave `DB_PASSWORD` empty if your local Postgres lets your user connect without one.

Use port `5432` for Postgres. The template's commented `DB_PORT=3306` is the MySQL default, and a MySQL server may be running on that port on the same machine.

### 5.3 Check which database Laravel is using

```bash
php artisan config:show database.default
php artisan config:show database.connections.pgsql.database
php artisan db:show
```

`db:show` lists the tables of the connected database. A new database shows `Tables .. 0`.

## 6. Migrations

Create the schema on an empty database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

To drop every table and rebuild from scratch:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
```

`migrate:fresh` deletes all data in the database named in `.env`. Check the name with `config:show` first.

Things to know:

- **Create migrations hold the whole table.** Columns, indexes and defaults live in the table's own `create_*_table` migration. Add a new column by editing that migration only while no shared database has run it. Otherwise add a new alter migration.
- **Order matters.** A foreign key needs its target table to exist, so a table's create migration must sort after the one it points to. Rename the timestamp if you need to reorder.
- **Four foreign keys are added at the end.** `add_deferred_foreign_keys` adds them because the tables point at each other or at themselves: `users.current_workspace_id`, `workflows.current_version_id`, `runs.parent_node_id` and `agent_sessions.parent_session_id`.
- **Existing databases need a rebuild.** Several create migrations were renamed. A database that already ran the old file names sees the renamed ones as new, so run `migrate:fresh` on it.

## 7. Passport (API authentication)

The `api` guard uses Passport. The migrations create the `oauth_*` tables. Two things remain: the encryption keys and a password client.

### 7.1 Check the current state

```bash
ls -l storage/oauth-*.key
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U <your-user> -d <database> -Atc "select count(*) from oauth_clients"
```

You want both key files and `0` clients on a fresh database.

### 7.2 Create the keys (only if missing)

```bash
php artisan passport:keys
```

Add `--force` only to replace existing keys. Replacing them signs everyone out.

### 7.3 Create the password client

```bash
php artisan passport:client --password
```

If the flags differ in your Passport version, check `php artisan passport:client --help`. The command prints a client ID and a secret. The secret is shown only once, so copy it straight away.

### 7.4 Add the client to `.env`

```dotenv
PASSPORT_PASSWORD_CLIENT_ID=<the id>
PASSPORT_PASSWORD_CLIENT_SECRET=<the secret>
```

Then clear any cached config:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
```

### 7.5 Check that it works

Sign in through the login endpoint and confirm the response contains an access token.

`PASSPORT_PASSWORD_CLIENT_ID` is blank in `.env.example`, and a blank value is fine for `migrate` and `migrate:fresh`. The migration that adds the `social_exchange` grant skips blank values.

## 8. Run the app

Herd serves the site, so there is no need to run `php artisan serve` yourself. Use `composer run dev` to start the supporting processes:

```bash
composer run dev
```

It starts the server, the Horizon queue listener, Reverb (websockets), the log viewer (Pail) and Vite.

If a frontend change does not show up, run `npm run build` or keep `npm run dev` running.

## 9. Tests and code style

```bash
php artisan test --compact
php artisan test --compact --filter=SomeTest
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent
```

The test suite runs on SQLite, so it does not touch your PostgreSQL database. Run Pint before you commit any PHP change.

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| Your database tool shows many tables, but `db:show` says 0 | The tool is connected to a different database, or it is listing system tables (`pg_catalog`, `information_schema`). Check the database name at the top of the tool's panel and reconnect. |
| The wrong database is in use after editing `.env` | Cached config. Run `php artisan config:clear`. |
| `migrate:fresh` fails with an `oauth_clients` or uuid error | Fixed in the `social_exchange` migration, which now skips a blank `PASSPORT_PASSWORD_CLIENT_ID`. Pull the latest code. |
| `relation "..." does not exist` while migrating | A create migration sorts before the table it points at. See the order notes in [Migrations](#6-migrations). |
| Connects to MySQL instead of Postgres | `DB_PORT` is `3306`. Set `DB_CONNECTION=pgsql` and `DB_PORT=5432`. |
| Search over embeddings is slow | `document_embeddings.embedding` is a `json` column, and the `pgvector` extension is not installed, so there is no vector index. |

## Adding to this guide

Add new steps under the section they belong to, and a row to Troubleshooting for any error that cost time. Keep commands copy-pasteable and say what each one changes.
